# Approachable Art 

This is a web application project for DIGIT 400 at Penn State Behrend. The aim of this website was to learn and practice fundamentals learned in class as well as expand code outside of the classroom. The personal aim of Approachable Art is to create a space where people can go and learn about art without the fancy language and talk about art without feeling "dumb." Art should be able to be appricated by everyone and not separated by the barrier of discourse. The site is still a work in progress but has many working goals for the future.
