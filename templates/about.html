    <hr>
    <p> Welcome to Approachable Art! This web app was created to aid the average joe in learning about the wonderful world of art and its history. Browsing our galleries, you will be taken on an adventure from France in the Baroque period to Italy in the Renaissance period and beyond. Whether you’re learning for pleasure or cramming to impress your boss, we have the information for you.</p>

    <p> Approachable Art is the brainchild of Olivia Coghe, a student at Penn State Behrend. Olivia is a double major in Digital Media, Art, and Technology as well as Arts Administration. Approachable Art has been a way for her to combine her various passions including art, programming, and education(at least into one. She firmly believes that no art should be out of reach and that everyone should have the opportunity to enjoy art’s many beauties and stories.</p> 

    <p> Olivia personally curates each gallery with information and accompanying photos. She encourages the breaking down of the seemingly foreign discourse we often encounter in the art world.</p> 

    <p>The aim of this project is to provide simple, accessible art lessons that quickly and efficiently teach the main concepts of a given topic to our aspiring learners.</p>
